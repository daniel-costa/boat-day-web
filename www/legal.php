Without limiting the foregoing, Our Services are not available to children (persons under the age of 18) or to temporarily or indefinitely terminated Participants. Any access to or use of the Application or Services by anyone under 18 is expressly prohibited. By becoming a Participant, You represent and warrant that You are at least 18 years old. By using the Application or the Services, You represent and warrant that You have the right, authority and capacity to enter into this Agreement and to abide by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
					<p>You are the sole authorized user of Your account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any password provided by You or the Company for accessing the Services. You are solely and fully responsible for all activities that occur under Your password or account. The Company has no control over the use of any User's account and expressly disclaims any liability derived therefrom. Should You suspect that any unauthorized party may be using Your password or account or You suspect any other breach of security, You will contact Us immediately.</p>
					<h3>BoatDay Event Listings</h3>
					<p>As a Participant, You may create and list BoatDays as open to Guests via the Application and Services (“Listings”). To create a Listing, You will be asked a variety of questions about the BoatDay to be listed, including, but not limited to, the location of the boat, capacity, size, features, suggested voluntary contribution and related rules and financial terms. Listings will be made publicly available via the Application and Services. Other Members will be able to view Your Listings via the Application and Services based upon the information provided in Your Listing. You understand and agree that once a Guest requests a confirmation on Your BoatDay, You may not request the Guest to pay a higher suggested voluntary contribution than in the Listing request.</p>
					<p>You acknowledge and agree that You are responsible for any and all Listings You post. Accordingly, You represent and warrant that any Listing You post and the confirmation of, or a Guest's participation in, a BoatDay in a Listing You post (i) will not breach any agreements You have entered into with any third parties, such as a boat club agreement, boat lease or rental agreements, or insurance agreement and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws (such as boater safety laws and laws governing rentals of boats and marine vessels), Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any BoatDay included in a Listing You post (including having all required permits, licenses and registrations), and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that the Company assumes no responsibility for a Host’s compliance with any agreements with or duties to third parties, applicable laws, rules and regulations. Peer-to-Pier reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that Peer-to-Pier, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of this Agreement, or otherwise harmful to the Application or Services.</p>
					<p>If You are a Host, You understand and agree that Peer-to-Pier does not act as an insurer or as Your contracting agent. If a Guest requests participation in Your BoatDay and participates in Your BoatDay, any agreement You enter into with such Guest is between You and the Guest and Peer-to-Pier is not a party thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Peer-to-Pier serves as the limited authorized payment collection agent of the Host for the purpose of accepting, on behalf of the Host, payments from Guests of such suggested contributions stipulated by the Host.</p>
					<p>If You are a Host, BoatDay makes certain tools available to You to help You to make informed decisions about which Members You choose to accept for participation in Your BoatDays. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Host, You are responsible for Your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who participate in or are otherwise present at the Boatday at Your request or invitation, excluding the Guest (and the individuals the Guest invites to the BoatDay, if applicable.).</p>
					<p>Peer-to-Pier requires that every Host obtain appropriate insurance for any boat registered by such Host on the Application (each a “Registered Boat”), and used to create Listings and participate in BoatDays. Please review any insurance policy that You may have for Your Registered Boat carefully, and in particular please make sure that You are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not Your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Guests (and any individuals the Guest invites onto the Registered Boat, if applicable) while participating in Your BoatDay.</p>
					<h3>Event Requests and Financial Terms</h3>
					<p>Hosts, not Peer-to-Pier, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed BoatDays and making available any BoatDays listed through the Application or Services. Listings for BoatDays will specify the total suggested Contribution per Guest or group of Guests. If a request to join a BoatDay is cancelled (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Host), any amounts collected by Peer-to-Pier will be refunded to such Guest, depending on the selections the Guest makes via the Application and Services, and any pre-authorization of such Guest’s credit card will be released, if applicable.</p>
					<p>In connection with Your initial request to participate in a BoatDay, You will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Peer-to-Pier or its third-party payment processor. You agree to pay Peer-to-Pier for any Contributions made in connection with Your account in accordance with this Agreement by one of the methods described on the Application or Services. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting participation in the BoatDay, either directly by Peer-to-Pier or indirectly, via a third-party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the BoatDay Platform or Services. You also authorize Peer-to-Pier to charge Your credit card in the event of damage caused to a Registered Boat on which You are a Guest, as contemplated under “Damage Fee” below, if applicable. If You are directed to Peer-to-Pier’s third-party payment processor, You may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services.</p>
					<h3>Payments</h3>
					<p>Voluntary Contributions. As a Guest, You may elect to make a voluntary contribution for the BoatDay a Host has provided You access to (a “Contribution”). The decision whether to make a Contribution and the amount of the Contribution is at Your sole discretion, and the Host will not receive any compensation or consideration for Your participation in the BoatDay other than the amount (if any) of this Contribution. As a Host, You may receive from a Guest a Contribution for the BoatDay You have hosted. Each Host acknowledges that the decision to provide such Contribution and the amount of the Contribution is at the Guest’s sole discretion, and that the Host will not request from Guest or receive any compensation or consideration for allowing Guests to participate in a BoatDay other than the amount (if any) of the Contribution. A Contribution may be any amount from $0 up, as specified by Guest. If, within twenty-four (24) hours after a completion a BoatDay, a Guest does not identify a specific Contribution amount for such Event, the Company will assume that the Guest selects the suggested Contribution amount for the BoatDay, as specified by the Host when creating the Listing, and the Guest’s credit card will automatically be charged that amount. IT IS THE GUEST’S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, AND NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COPMANY, TO DECIDE WHETHER TO PAY THE CONTRIBUTION AMOUNT SUGGESTED BY THE HOST, OR HOW MUCH TO OTHERWISE CONTRIBUTE TO THE HOST.</p>
					<p>Fees. The Company receives an administrative fee of 27% (the “Administrative Fee”) of each Contribution of more than $0 that a Guest makes to a Host, net of the $4.00 per ride trust & safety fee (the “Trust & Safety Fee” and, together with the Administrative Fee, the “Payment Fees”). For the sake of clarity, the Administrative Fee is assessed on a Contribution after the assessment of the Trust & Safety Fee. Peer-to-Pier may change the Payment Fees as We deem necessary for our business. We encourage You to check this Agreement periodically if You are interested in keeping abreast of the rate of our Payment Fees.</p>
					<p>Refunds. The full amount of the Contribution (including the Administrative Fee), is charged immediately following completion of such election to the Guest’s authorized credit card and transferred (less the Administrative Fee) to the Host. All payments made are non-refundable. This no-refund policy shall apply at all times regardless of a Your decision to terminate usage of the Application or Services, our decision to terminate Your usage, disruption caused to our Services either planned, accidental or intentional, or any other reason whatsoever.</p>
					<p>Promotional Offers. The Company, at its sole discretion, may make available promotional offers with different features to any of Our customers. These promotional offers, unless made to You, shall have no bearing whatsoever on Your offer or contract.</p>
					<p>Host Cancellations. If, as a Host, You cancel a BoatDay for which there are confirmed Guests within 24 hours of the scheduled departure of such BoatDay, the Company may apply penalties or consequences to You or Your Listing, including (i) publishing an automated review on Your Listing indicating that a reservation was cancelled, (ii) keeping the calendar for Your Listing unavailable or blocked for the dates of the cancelled booking, or (iii) imposing a cancellation fee of $6.00 per confirmed Guest at the time of cancellation (the “Host Cancellation Fee”). Peer-to- Pier may change the Host Cancellation Fee as We deem necessary for our business. We encourage You to check this Agreement periodically if You are interested in keeping abreast of the rate of our Host Cancellation Fee.</p>
					<p>In certain circumstances, the Company may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary or desirable to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Application or Services. The Company may also determine, in its sole discretion, to refund to a Guest part or all of the amount charged to a Guest for participation on a BoatDay. You agree that the Company and the relevant Guest or Host will not have any liability for such cancellations or refunds.</p>
					<p>Guest Cancellations. In the event that a Guest, who has been confirmed on a BoatDay by the Host of such BoatDay, cancels such confirmed participation within 24 hours prior to the scheduled departure of such BoatDay (in the time zone of the applicable BoatDay), such Guest agrees to pay a cancellation fee equivalent to the Contribution set by the Host for the subject BoatDay from which the Guest has cancelled (the “Guest Cancellation Fee”). Peer-to-Pier may change the Guest Cancellation Fee as We deem necessary for our business. We encourage You to check this Agreement periodically if You are interested in keeping abreast of the rate of our Guest Cancellation Fee.</p>
					<p>Damage Fee. Guests are responsible for leaving the Registered Boat in the condition it was in when they arrived. Each Guest acknowledges and agrees that, as a Guest, You are responsible for Your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any non-Member individuals who You bring to the BoatDay. In the event that a Host reports to the Company that a Guest (or any non-Member individual who the Guest has brought to the BoatDay) has in any manner materially damaged the Host’s Registered Boat (“a Damage Claim”), Guest agrees to pay a “Damage Charge” of either $50, $100 or $300 depending on the extent of the damage (as determined by Peer-to-Pier in its sole discretion), which shall constitute full payment for Host’s cost of repairing or cleaning the Registered Boat, or otherwise remediating the damage. After being notified of the Damage Claim and given (48) hours to respond, the payment will be charged to and taken from the credit card on file in Your BoatDay Account. The Damage Charge shall be transferred to Host less any applicable Fees or payment processing charges. Peer-to-Pier reserves the right (but is not obligated) to verify or otherwise require documentation of damages prior to processing the Damage Charge. If We are unable to charge the credit card on file or otherwise collect payment from You, You agree to remit payment for any damage to the Registered Boat to the applicable Host or to Peer-to-Pier (if applicable).</p>
					<p>In the event that a Host makes a Damage Claim against a Guest exceeding $300 (an “Excessive Damage Claim”), and provides evidence of damage, including but not limited to photographs, Guest agrees to pay the cost of replacing the damaged items with equivalent items (as determined by Peer-to-Pier in its sole discretion). After being notified of the Excessive Damage Claim and given (48) hours to respond, the payment will be charged to and taken from the credit card on file in Your BoatDay Account. The Damage Charge shall be transferred to Host less any applicable Fees or payment processing charges. Peer-to-Pier reserves the right (but is not obligated) to verify or otherwise require documentation of damages prior to processing the Damage Charge. If We are unable to charge the credit card on file or otherwise collect payment from You, You agree to remit payment for any damage to the Registered Boat to the applicable Host or to Peer-to-Pier (if applicable).</p>
					<p>Facilitation of Payments. All Contributions and applicable fees shall be facilitated through Braintree Payment Solutions LLC, Peer-to-Pier’s third-party payment processing service,</p>
					<p>Fee Changes. The Company may change the fees for Our Services or Application, as We deem necessary for Our business. We encourage You to check back at Our website periodically if You are interested about how We charge for the Service or Application.</p>
					<h3>Insurance</h3>
					<p>1. Excess Liability Coverage: Peer-to-Pier procures an excess insurance policy that provides each Host with excess passenger liability insurance of $500,000.00 per occurrence (the “Excess Coverage”). The policy offers excess passenger liability protection over a Host's existing boat insurance while such Host is hosting Guest(s) on a BoatDay arranged through the Application. The Excess Coverage is limited to liability only and does not provide coverage for collision, comprehensive or wear and tear damage to a Host’s Registered Boat. As with any boat insurance policy, additional insurance terms, limitations, and exclusions apply, including but not limited to:</li>

						<li>Excluding the following craft or vessels:</li>

					</ul>
					<p>We do not procure insurance for, nor are We responsible for, personal belongings left in the Registered Boat by Host(s) or Guest(s).</p>
					<p>THIS IS AN UNOFFICIAL SUMMARY OF PEER-TO-PIER’S MASTER INSURANCE POLICY AND MAY NOT ALWAYS BE UP-TO-DATE. NONE OF THE STATEMENTS IN THIS SECTION SHOULD BE INTERPRETED AS BINDING AND ARE PROVIDED FOR QUICK REFERENCE ONLY.</p>
					<p>2. Private Boat Insurance. As an express condition of receiving access to the Application and the Services as a Host, and at receiving access to the Application and the Services as a Host, at Your sole expense, You agree to maintain current during the life of this Agreement, third- party boat insurance of the types and amounts specified as follows for every Registered Boat used to host BoatDays under this Agreement:</p>
					<p>Each Host shall have and maintain their own protection and indemnity, including passenger liability, with minimum limits of $300,000 any once accident or occurrence with an A.M. Best rated carrier, for the operation of such Host’s Registered Boat to cover any anticipated losses related to such Host’s BoatDays shared with Guests.</p>
					<p>You acknowledge that it is Your responsibility to insure that Your insurance policy provides coverage for the usage of Your Registered Boat as provided hereunder. If You have any questions or concerns about the scope or applicability of Your insurance coverage, it is Your responsibility, not Peer-to-Pier’s, to resolve them. You acknowledge that failure to secure or maintain satisfactory insurance coverage shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and shall result in the denial of Excess Coverage, immediate suspension of the Agreement and loss of Your right to use Your Registered Boat as provided hereunder.</p>
