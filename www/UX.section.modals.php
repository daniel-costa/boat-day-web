From departure time to location, price, and all of the day’s activities, Hosts provide you with the information you need to pick your perfect BoatDay. Whether you’re looking to fish, sail, cruise and more, use custom search filters to find your ideal BoatDay and request a spot on-board. </p>
							<p>BoatDays are great for groups of all sizes. Whether you’re a small group looking for an affordable way to enjoy boating without the cost of reserving an entire boat, or a big group looking for a private experience, request as many seats as you need on-board.</p>

Your feedback is valuable to us and the Hosts as we try to provide the best BoatDay experiences.

Accordingly, You represent and warrant that any Listing You post and the confirmation of, or a Guest's participation in, a BoatDay (i) will not breach any agreements You have entered into with any third parties, including but not limited to boat club agreement, boat lease, rental or charter agreements, or insurance agreements and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws (including but not limited to boater safety laws and laws governing usage of boats and marine vessels), Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any BoatDay or Listing You post (including having all required permits, licenses and registrations), and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties.

						<p>If You are a Host, You understand and agree that Peer to Pier does not act as an insurer or as Your contracting agent. If a Guest requests participation in Your BoatDay and participates in Your BoatDay (including a Captained BoatDay), any agreement You enter into with such Guest (or applicable Captain) is between You and the Guest (or applicable Captain) and Peer to Pier is not a party thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Peer-to-Pier serves as the limited authorized payment collection agent of the Host for the purpose of accepting, on behalf of the Host, any and all payments from Guests for participation in a BoatDay.</p>
						<p>If You are a Captain, You understand and agree that Peer to Pier does not act as an insurer or as Your contracting agent. If You agree to operate a Host&rsquo;s Registered Boat on a Captained BoatDay, any agreement you enter into with such Host is between You and the Host.</p>
						<p>If You are a Host, BoatDay makes certain tools available to You to help You to make informed decisions about which Members You choose to accept for participation in Your BoatDays. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Host, You are responsible for Your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who participate in or are otherwise present at Your BoatDay at Your request or invitation, including the Captain of a Captained BoatDay (if applicable), excluding Guests (and any individuals who participate in or are otherwise present at Your BoatDay at the request or invitation of a Guest).</p>
						<p>You acknowledge and agree that, as a Guest, You are responsible for Your own acts and omissions and You are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any non-Member individuals who participate in or are otherwise present at a BoatDay at Your request or invitation.</p>
						<p>Peer-to-Pier requires that each Host obtain and maintain appropriate insurance for any Registered Boat, and that each Charter Host at all times maintains a Charter boat insurance scheduling any Registered Boat.  By creating a Host account and selecting "I already use my boat(s) to carry paying guests" and/or becoming a Charter Host, You certify that Your boat/company meets all United States Coast Guard (&quot;USCG&quot;) standards and regulations, that You will list Peer to Pier Technologies as an additional insured on your charter boat insurance policy, and that You will at all times maintain current charter boat insurance coverage for your Registered Boat. Please review any insurance policy that You may have for Your Registered Boat carefully, and in particular please make sure that You are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not Your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Guests (and any individuals the Guest invites onto the Registered Boat, if applicable) while participating in Your BoatDay. You will only provide Services using a Registered Boat that has been reported to and for which information has been provided to and approved by Peer to Pier.</p>
						<h2>NO ENDORSEMENT</h2>
						<p>Peer to Pier does not endorse any Member or any BoatDay. You understand that Listings are intended only to indicate a representation of the Registered Boat and the BoatDay and are therefore not an endorsement by Peer to Pier of any Member, Registered Boat or any BoatDay. We therefore recommend that You always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to join a BoatDay or to accept a participation request from a Guest, or to have any other interaction with any other Member. </p>
						<p>By using the Platform or Services, You agree that any legal remedy or liability that You seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused You harm. You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy from Peer to Pier with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, We encourage You to communicate directly with other Members on the Platform and Services regarding any participation requests or Listings made by You.</p>
						<h2>PARTICIPATION REQUESTS AND FINANCIAL TERMS</h2>
						<p><em>Participation Requests and Financial Terms for Hosts</em></p>
						<p>Hosts, not Peer to Pier, are solely responsible for honoring any BoatDay confirmations and making available any BoatDays listed through the Platform or Services, including Captained BoatDays. If You are a Host and participation in Your BoatDay is requested via the Platform and Services, You will be required to either confirm or reject the participation request within the Participation Request Period, otherwise the participation request will be automatically cancelled.  Failure to respond to participation requests within the Participation Request Period may have an adverse effect on Your rating as a Host on the Platform. When participation in Your BoatDay is requested via the Platform and Services, We will share with You (i) the first name and last initial of the Guest who has requested participation in Your BoatDay, (ii) a link to the Guest&rsquo;s BoatDay Account profile page, (iii) the amount of seats requested by the Guest for the BoatDay, (iv) the message (if any) included by the Guest along with such request, and (v) if You have linked Your BoatDay Account to an SNS (defined below) the names of any members of an SNS with whom You are &quot;friends&quot; or associated on the SNS if such individuals are also &quot;friends&quot; or associated with the Guest on such SNS, so that You can view such information before confirming or rejecting the BoatDay participation request. If You are unable to confirm or decide to reject a BoatDay participation request within the Participation Request Period, any amounts collected by Peer to Pier for the participation request will be refunded to the applicable Guest&rsquo;s credit card and any pre-authorization of such credit card will be released, if applicable. When You confirm participation requested by a Guest, Peer to Pier will send You an email, text message or message via the Platform confirming such request.</p>
						<p>If You owe or agree to pay any amount to Peer to Pier, whether as a result of Your participation in BoatDays, actions as a Guest or otherwise, then Peer to Pier may (but is not obliged to) withhold the amount owing to Peer to Pier from any payout amounts due to You as a Host, and use the withheld amount to setoff the amount owed by You to Peer to Pier. </p>
						<p><em>Appointment of Peer to Pier as Payment Collection Agent For Hosts </em></p>
						<p>Each Host agrees that payment made by a Guest through the Platform shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Host, Each Host agrees that Peer to Pier may, in accordance with the Cancellation Policy (defined below) selected by the Host and reflected in the relevant Listing, permit the Guest to cancel a confirmed BoatDay participation request. Each Host understands that Peer to Pier (or its third-party payment processor) accepts payments from Guests as the Host&rsquo;s limited payment collection agent and that Peer to Pier&rsquo;s obligation to pay the Host is subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the associated payments from Guests. Peer to Pier does not guarantee payments to Hosts for amounts that have not been successfully received by Peer to Pier (or its third-party payment processor) from Guests. In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Host, Peer to Pier assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Host.</p>
						<p><em>Participation Requests and Financial Terms for Guests </em></p>
						<p>Hosts, not Peer to Pier, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed participation requests and making available any BoatDays reserved through the Platform and Services. If You, as a Guest, choose to enter into a transaction with a Host for participation in a BoatDay, You agree and understand that You will be required to enter into an agreement with the Host and You agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such BoatDay imposed by the Host. You acknowledge and agree that You, and not Peer to Pier, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Peer to Pier is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, Peer to Pier disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Peer to Pier is not a party to the agreement between You and the Host, Peer to Pier acts as the Host&rsquo;s payment collection agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from You on behalf of the Host. </p>
						<p>The Contribution for each BoatDay will be displayed to a Guest on each Listing before the Guest sends a participation request to a Host. As noted above, the Host is required to either confirm or reject the participation request within the Participation Request Period, otherwise the participation request will be automatically cancelled. If a participation request is cancelled or rejected (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Host), any amounts collected by Peer to Pier (or its third party payment processor) will be refunded to such Guest, and any pre-authorization of such Guest&rsquo;s credit card will be released, if applicable.</p>
						<p>You as a Guest agree to pay Peer to Pier any Contribution required (as applicable) for any BoatDay participation in connection with Your BoatDay Account, and/or any Contribution You elect to pay for any BoatDay participation in connection with Your BoatDay Account, for which Contributions are suggested rather than required. In order to establish a participation request pending the applicable Host&rsquo;s confirmation of Your request, You understand and agree that Peer to Pier reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via Your credit card for the Contribution or (ii) charge Your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), to verify Your credit card. Once Peer to Pier receives confirmation of Your Contribution, Peer to Pier (or its third-party payment processor) will collect the Contribution in accordance with this Agreement and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing. Please note that Peer to Pier cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Guest by his or her bank related to Peer to Pier&rsquo;s collection of the Contribution, and Peer to Pier disclaims all liability in this regard.</p>
						<p>In connection with the creation of Your BoatDay Account, You will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Peer-to-Pier or its third-party payment processor. You agree to pay Peer-to-Pier for any amounts owed in connection with Your BoatDay Account in accordance with this Agreement by one of the methods described on the Platform or Services.  You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided, either directly by Peer-to-Pier or indirectly, via a third-party online payment processor, by one of the payment methods described on the Platform or Services. You also authorize Peer-to-Pier to charge Your credit card in the event of damage caused to a Registered Boat on which You are a Guest, as contemplated below under &quot;Damages to Registered Boats,&quot; if applicable. If You are directed to Peer-to-Pier&rsquo;s third-party payment processor, You may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party&rsquo;s service and that third party&rsquo;s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services.</p>

The amount of the Guest Cancellation Fee charged to You will depend upon the terms of the applicable cancellation policy set by the Host for the applicable BoatDay. Details regarding refunds and cancellation policies are available via the Platform. The Trust & Safety Fee is non-refundable regardless of the cancellation policy selected by the Host.</p>

After being notified of the Damage Claim and given forty-eight (48) hours to respond, the applicable Damage Fee will be charged to the credit card on file in Your BoatDay Account.  The Damage Charge shall be transferred to Host less any applicable Fees or payment processing charges. If We are unable to charge the credit card on file or otherwise collect payment from You, You agree to remit payment for any damage to the Registered Boat to the applicable Host or to Peer-to-Pier (if applicable). </p>
						<p>Both Guests and Hosts agree to cooperate with and assist Peer to Pier in good faith, and to provide Peer to Pier with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Peer to Pier, in connection with any complaints or claims made by Members relating to BoatDays, Registered Boats or any personal or other property located onboard a Registered Boat, or with respect to any investigation undertaken by Peer to Pier or a representative of Peer to Pier regarding use or abuse of the Platform or the Services. </p>
