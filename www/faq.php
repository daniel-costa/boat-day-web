							<h2>What is a BoatDay?</h2>
							<p>A “BoatDay” is a fun day of boating with a local Host. And the best part, our app and per person pricing make booking a day of boating easier and more affordable than ever. </p>
							<p>Each BoatDay listing in the app will tell you all of the details you want to know. From departure time to location, price, and all of the day’s activities, Hosts provide you with the information you need to pick your perfect BoatDay. Whether you’re looking to fish, sail, cruise and more, use custom search filters to find your ideal BoatDay and request a spot on-board. </p>
							<p>BoatDays are great for groups of all sizes. Whether you’re a small group looking for an affordable way to enjoy boating without the cost of reserving an entire boat, or a big group looking for a private experience, request as many seats as you need on-board.</p>

							<h2 id="contibution">What is a "contribution"?</h2>
							<p>When a Host creates a BoatDay, they set the price or “contribution" for Guests on-board. This amount will be visible on the front of all BoatDay listings, as well as in the details for each BoatDay.</p>
							<p>For BoatDays hosted by <a href ="#charterHost">Charter Hosts</a>, the listed contribution will automatically be charged once the BoatDay is complete. For all other BoatDays, once the BoatDay is finished, you have 24 hours to submit a contribution amount to your Host. If you don't submit your contribution within that time period, we take it as a sign that you enjoyed your BoatDay, and the app will automatically charge the listed contribution amount to your credit card on file.</p>
							<p>Had an amazing time with your Host, or a BoatDay that far exceeded your expectations? You can always show your appreciation to the Host by increasing your contribution. If you feel you must reduce your contribution, be sure to tell us why! Your feedback is valuable to us and the Hosts as we try to provide the best BoatDay experiences. Remember, Hosts rely on contributions in making their boats available to you, and contributions are key to providing BoatDay's unparalleled and affordable per-person prices.</p>

Before a BoatDay, you'll be able to see your Host’s rating and they'll be able to see yours.

BoatDay is a peer-to-peer (or "peer-to-pier") sharing platform, meaning that our Hosts use their boats to host BoatDays with Guests they connect with through the app. Above all, BoatDay is all about trust, community, and safety. Our Hosts go through individual screenings, including background checks, insurance requirements, and boat quality standards. BoatDay does not fit in to the traditional boat charter/rental model, and we have a team dedicated to compliance with and development of regulations that fit the needs and safety of our community.</p>

								<h4>ARE BOATDAY HOSTS EMPLOYEES OF BOATDAY?</h4>

								<p>Paying or communicating outside BoatDay makes it harder for us to protect your information and puts you at greater risk of fraud and other security issues.
