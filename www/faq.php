							<h4>DO MY BOAT INSURANCE AND REGISTRATION NEED TO MATCH THE STATE I’M HOSTING IN?</h4>
							<p>Yes. Your boat insurance, registration, and address must match the state you’ll be hosting in. </p>

							<h4>CAN I EXIT THE APP AND COME BACK TO FINISH MY APPLICATION?</h4>
							<p>>>es! Your registration information will be saved and available, even if you close the app completely.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div id="essentials-2" class="faq-block">
						<a class="item" href="#"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> How does payment work?</a>
						<div class="inside">
							<p>Paying for BoatDays is done quickly and easily through the app, and is completely cash-free! When you request to join your first BoatDay, or accept your first invitation from a Host, you will be asked to input your credit card information.</p>
							<p>When your BoatDay is over, you will be prompted to confirm payment, and will have 24 hours to finalize your contribution. To show your appreciation for an amazing BoatDay, just hit the payment method and tap "+" to increase the contribution amount!</p>
							<p>Remember, Hosts rely on contributions in welcoming you on-board, and contributions are key to BoatDay's unparalleled per-person prices.</p>
							<h4>CAN BOATDAY HOSTS ACCEPT CASH?</h4>
							<p>It is against BoatDay's Terms and Conditions to accept cash directly from Guests. The platform, and the BoatDay experience, is specifically designed to let Hosts focus on enjoying a great BoatDay with their Guests, and not have to worry about collecting payments. Cash-free payment makes organizing great BoatDays easier for Hosts and Guests, and helps us to keep the community safe. </p>
							<h4>DO I HAVE TO PAY RIGHT AWAY?</h4>
							<p>You have 24 hours to finalize payment and review your Host. If you haven't done so after 24 hours, the <a href="#essentials-4">suggested contribution amount</a> will automatically be charged to your credit card and you will no longer be able to leave a review.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div id="essentials-3" class="faq-block">
						<a class="item" href="#"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> How much does BoatDay cost? </a>
						<div class="inside">
							<p>The suggested contribution amount for each BoatDay is set by the Host.  Learn more about <a href="#essentials-4">suggested contributions</a>. Because of our unprecedented per-person pricing, BoatDay is usually much cheaper (and more fun) than other boating options.</p>
							<h4>CAN I SEE HOW MUCH THE BOATDAY WILL BE BEFORE I JOIN IT?</h4>
							<p>Yes! The suggested contribution will be listed on the front of the listing for each BoatDay. It will also be included in the BoatDay details when you click on any specific.  Once the BoatDay is over, the app will display the suggested contribution for your BoatDay and will allow you to review your Host. Don't forget, if your Host goes above and beyond, feel free to increase the suggested contribution.</p>
							<h4>WHAT IS THE TRUST &amp; SAFETY FEE?</h4>
							<p>The safety of all BoatDay passengers is our top priority and is taken into account with everything we do. The Trust &amp; Safety Fee of $5.00 per Guest supports our leading safety standards, including background checks, excess liability insurance and ongoing back-end support.</p>

					</div>
					<div id="essentials-4" class="faq-block">
						<a class="item" href="#"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> What is a "suggested contribution"?</a>
						<div class="inside">
							<p>When a Host creates a BoatDay, they set a "suggested contribution" amount for Guests on-board. This amount will be visible on the front of all BoatDay listings, as well as in the details for each BoatDay. Once your BoatDay is finished, you have 24 hours to make any changes to the suggested contribution amount that your Host will receive. If you don't make any changes to the listed amount, we take it as a sign that you enjoyed your BoatDay, and the app will automatically charge your credit card on file.  </p>
							<p>Had an amazing time with your Host, or a BoatDay that far exceeded your expectations? You can always show your appreciation to the Host by increasing your contribution.</p>
							<p>If you feel you must reduce your contribution, be sure to tell us why! Your feedback is valuable to us and the Hosts as well.  Remember, Hosts rely on contributions in making their boats available to you, and contributions are key to providing BoatDay's unparalleled and affordable per-person prices.  </p>

					<div id="essentials-5" class="faq-block">
						<a class="item" href="#"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> Advanced Scheduling and Cancellations</a>
						<div class="inside">
							<h4>CAN I SCHEDULE A BOATDAY IN ADVANCE?</h4>
							<p>Yes!  The calendar view allows you to browse BoatDays by date of departure, so if you're looking for a specific day, check the calendar to see what's available. When you find what you're looking for, even if its weeks away, you can request a spot!</p>
							<h4>WHAT IF I HAVE TO CANCEL?</h4>
							<p>If you can't make it to your BoatDay, you can cancel your confirmed seat up to 24 hours prior to the scheduled departure time for that BoatDay.  We will also notify the Host and free them up to invite another Guest aboard.</p>
							<p>To cancel, go to the "My BoatDays" section in the navigation panel, select the BoatDay you would like to cancel, from the "Attending" tab and follow the prompts. The pre-authorization to your credit card will be cancelled, minus the $5.00 Trust &amp; Safety Fee.</p>
							<p>As a Guest, if you cancel within 24 hours prior to the scheduled departure time for that BoatDay, or no-show on the day of the event, you will be charged the <a href="#essentials-4">suggested contribution amount</a> listed for that BoatDay.</p>

						<a class="item" href="#"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> Rating other Users</a>
						<div class="inside">
							<h4>WHAT IS THE REVIEW AND STAR RATING FOR?</h4>
							<p>BoatDay aims to deliver reliability and trust with each BoatDay event. In order to ensure that every experience meets your and our high community expectations, each Host and Guest is expected to uphold the BoatDay standards and community values.</p>
							<p>After each BoatDay, you have the opportunity to rate and review your Host, and they will rate you as well. In browsing for BoatDay events, requesting a seat, or inviting Guests on board, you'll be able to see user's ratings.  Each review you give can have an impact on that Host or Guest's use of the platform, as users with a low star rating, or poor reviews, may not have their requests accepted as often.</p>
							<h4>WHAT SHOULD FACTOR INTO THE REVIEWS I GIVE OTHER USERS?</h4>
							<p>The star rating and review should be based on your experience with the other users on your BoatDay. When reviewing your Host, consider whether he/she was friendly, safe, a good navigator, true to the BoatDay listing, and made you want to use BoatDay again.  When reviewing Guests, consider whether he/she was friendly, fun, respectful, and made your BoatDay more enjoyable.  </p>
							<p>5 stars means that your experience was great, and met the BoatDay standards. Anything lower than 5 indicates that there was room for improvement, but be sure to leave a respectful review.  If you had a serious issue, use the flagging tool for users and events to privately tell us what went wrong.</p>

						<a class="item" href="#"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> How BoatDay and BoatDay Hosts are Classified</a>
						<div class="inside">
							<h4>IS BOATDAY A BOAT CHARTER OR RENTAL SERVICE?</h4>
							<p>BoatDay is not a boat charter or rental service. BoatDay is a peer-to-peer (or "peer-to-pier") transportation platform, meaning that our Hosts use their own boats to host BoatDays with guests they connect with through the app. Above all, BoatDay is all about trust, community, and safety. Our Hosts go through individual screenings, including background checks, insurance compliance requirements, and boat quality standards. BoatDay does not fit in to the traditional boat charter/rental model, and we have a team dedicated to compliance with and development of regulations that fit the needs and safety of our community.</p>
							<h4>ARE BOATDAY HOSTS EMPLOYEES OF BOATDAY?</h4>
							<p>Hosts and Guests are users of the platform and are not employees of Peer-to-Pier Technologies, LLC. As members of the community platform, Hosts and Guests are not entitled to benefits, worker's compensation, or unemployment insurance.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div id="essentials-11" class="faq-block">
						<a class="item" href="#"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> How long is a BoatDay?</a>
						<div class="inside">
							<p>To ensure the safety and comfort of our community, BoatDays are limited to 12 hours. Overnight trips are not permitted (its a Boat"DAY"), and BoatDay boats are limited to travel within a 12 mile distance of the nearest shorline.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div id="essentials-12" class="faq-block">
						<a class="item" href="#"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> Can I use a Captain for my BoatDay?</a>
						<div class="inside">
							<p>Yes! If you are a Host, and want a licensed captain for your BoatDay, you can register a captain with us in a few easy steps: </p>
							<h4>HOW TO REGISTER A CAPTAIN</h4>
							<p>Have a trusted captain you would like to use? Email us at <a href="mailto:captains@boatdayapp.com">captains@boatdayapp.com</a> with:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>a copy of the captain's professional license and any other certifications</li>
								<li>proof that the captain is covered under the primary insurance policy for your registered Boat, or proof of valid professional liability insurance held by the captain </li>
								<li>a photo of the captain</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Once we have received these items, and the captain has passed the standard BoatDay background screening, you're all set.</p>
							
							<h4>REQUESTING A CAPTAIN</h4>
							<p>Contact us at <a href="mailto:captains@boatdayapp.com">captains@boatdayapp.com</a> and we'll try and connect you with a local captain in your area.  To ensure the best chance of finding an available captain, please submit all requests at least 3 days before your intended BoatDay.</p>
							
							<h4>"ON-BOARDING" YOUR CAPTAIN</h4>
							<p>Once your captain has been registered, the captain must be "on-boarded" in your BoatDay listing.</p>
							<p>In order to on-board a captain, you must:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>mention that your BoatDay will have a captain, as well as the captain's name, in your BoatDay event description, and</li>
								<li>include the captain's picture as one of your allotted profile photos, or</li>
								<li>include the captain as a confirmed Guest on your BoatDay.</li>
								<!-- <li>include the captain's picture as one of the three allotted photos for your BoatDay event</li> -->
								<!-- <li>expressly mention that your BoatDay will have a captain, as well as the captain's name, in your BoatDay event description</li> -->
							</ol>
							<p>On-boarding helps build User trust and confidence, and provides extra reassurance to potential Guests.</p>
